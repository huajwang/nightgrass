<h2 class="article-title">Problem S4: Swapping Seats</h2>
<h3>Problem Description</h3>
<p>There are N people sitting at a circular table for a long session of negotiations. Each person
belongs to one of the three groups: A, B, or C. A group is happy if all of its members are sitting
contiguously in a block of consecutive seats. You would like to make all groups happy by some
sequence of swap operations. In each swap operation, two people exchange seats with each other.
What is the minimum number of swaps required to make all groups happy?
</p>
<h3>Input Specification</h3>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1 000 000) characters, where each
character is A, B, or C. The i-th character denotes the group of the person initially sitting at the i-th
seat at the table, where seats are numbered in clockwise order.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>For 4 of the 15 available marks, the input has no C characters and N ≤ 5 000.</li>
  <li>For an additional 4 of the 15 available marks, the input has no C characters.</li>
  <li>For an additional 4 of the 15 available marks, N ≤ 5 000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output Specification</h3>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimum possible number of swaps.</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>
BABCBCACCA
</pre>
<h3>Output for Sample Input</h3>
<pre>2</pre>
<h3>Explanation of Output for Sample Input</h3>
<p>In one possible sequence, the first swap results in the seating layout AABCBCBCCA. After the
second swap, the layout is AABBBCCCCA.
