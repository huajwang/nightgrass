<h2 class="article-title">Problem S3: Searching for Strings</h2>
<h3>Problem Description</h3>
<p>You’re given a string N, called the needle, and a string H, called the haystack, both of which
contain only lowercase letters “a”..“z”.
Write a program to count the number of distinct permutations of N which appear as a substring of
H at least once. Note that N can have anywhere between 1 and |N|! distinct permutations in total
– for example, the string “aab” has 3 distinct permutations (“aab”, “aba”, and “baa”).
</p>
<h3>Input Specification</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The first line contains N (1 ≤ |N| ≤ 200 000), the needle string.</li>
  <li>The second line contains H (1 ≤ |H| ≤ 200 000), the haystack string.</li>
  <li>For 3 of the 15 available marks, |N| ≤ 8 and |H| ≤ 200.</li>
  <li>For an additional 2 of the 15 available marks, |N| ≤ 200 and |H| ≤ 200.</li>
  <li>For an additional 2 of the 15 available marks, |N| ≤ 2000 and |H| ≤ 2000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output Specification</h3>
<p>Output consists of one integer, the number of distinct permutations of N which appear as a substring of H.</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>
aab
abacabaa
</pre>
<h3>Output for Sample Input</h3>
<pre>2</pre>
<h3>Explanation of Output for Sample Input</h3>
<p>The permutations “aba” and “baa” each appear as substrings of H (the former appears twice),
while the permutation “aab” does not appear.

    else:
