<h2 class="article-title">Problem S2: Tandem Bicycle</h2>
<h3>Problem Description</h3>
<p>
Since time immemorial, the citizens of Dmojistan and Pegland have been at war. Now, they have
finally signed a truce. They have decided to participate in a tandem bicycle ride to celebrate the
truce. There are N citizens from each country. They must be assigned to pairs so that each pair
contains one person from Dmojistan and one person from Pegland.
Each citizen has a cycling speed. In a pair, the fastest person will always operate the tandem
bicycle while the slower person simply enjoys the ride. In other words, if the members of a pair
have speeds a and b, then the bike speed of the pair is max(a, b). The total speed is the sum of the
N individual bike speeds.
For this problem, in each test case, you will be asked to answer one of two questions:
  <ul>
    <li>Question 1: what is the minimum total speed, out of all possible assignments into pairs?</li>
    <li>Question 2: what is the maximum total speed, out of all possible assignments into pairs?</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Input Specification</h3>
<p>
The first line will contain the type of question you are to solve, which is either 1 or 2.
The second line contains N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100).
The third line contains N space-separated integers: the speeds of the citizens of Dmojistan.
The fourth line contains N space-separated integers: the speeds of the citizens of Pegland.
Each person’s speed will be an integer between 1 and 1 000 000.
For 8 of the 15 available marks, questions of type 1 will be asked. For 7 of the 15 available marks,
questions of type 2 will be asked.

<h3>Explanation for Output for Sample Input 1</h3>
<p>There is a unique optimal solution:
  <ul>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 5 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 6.</li>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 1 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 2.</li>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 4 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 4.</li>

There are multiple possible optimal solutions. Here is one optimal solution:
  <ul>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 5 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 2.</li>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 1 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 6.</li>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 4 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 4.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Explanation for Output for Sample Input 3</h3>
<p>
There are multiple possible optimal solutions. Here is one optimal solution:
  <ul>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 202 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 1.</li>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 177 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 540.</li>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 189 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 17.</li>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 589 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 78.</li>
    <li>Pair the citizen from Dmojistan with speed 102 and the citizen from Pegland with speed 496.</li>
  </ul>
This sum yields 202 + 540 + 189 + 589 + 496 = 2016.
