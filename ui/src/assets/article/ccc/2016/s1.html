<h3>Problem Description</h3>
<p>An anagram of a string is formed by rearranging the letters in the string. For example, the anagrams
of aab are aab, aba, and baa.
A wildcard anagram of a string is an anagram of the string where some of the letters might have
been replaced with an asterisk (*). For example, two possible wildcard anagrams of aab are *ab
and *b*.
Given two strings, determine whether the second string is a wildcard anagram of the first string.
</p>
<h3>Input Specification</h3>
<p>The two lines of input will both consist of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) characters. Each character in the first
line will be a lowercase letter. Each character in the second line will be either a lowercase letter or
an asterisk.
For 8 of the 15 available marks, the second line will not contain any asterisk characters.
</p>
<h3>Output Specification</h3>
<p>
Output the character A if the string on the second line is a wildcard anagram of the string on the
first line. Otherwise, output the character N.
